## 📈 Key Insights

- The **West** region generated the highest sales, but the **Central** region had better profit margins.
- **Office Supplies** had the most orders, but **Technology** delivered the highest revenue.
- A sharp drop in profits was observed for **Tables** despite high sales — suggesting high discounting or low margins.
- Peak sales occurred during **November and December**, likely due to holiday seasons.
